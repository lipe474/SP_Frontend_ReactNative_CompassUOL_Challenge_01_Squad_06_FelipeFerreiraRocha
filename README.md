# SP React Native - CompassUOL - Challenge 01 - Squad 06 - Felipe Ferreira Rocha

This project is intended for the Compass UOL Scholarship Program. It is the first practical challenge aimed at applying the concepts of HTML, CSS and Typescript, in the construction of a main screen of several posts and redirecting to the screen of a post when a post is chosen. 

A call is made to the Fake API **{JSON} Placeholder** to retrieve data for __title, content and comments__ and a call is also made to the **Pexels** API to retrieve __images__.

## Starting the project

- In the terminal, use the `tsc` command to compile the files from Typescript to Javascript

- It is necessary to use a local server through extensions such as `Live Server`, otherwise the API requests will not be called



> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some HTML elements are created when data comes from API's (JSON Placeholder and Pexels). Therefore, it is crucial to use a local server such as **Live Server**
